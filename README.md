Corn Yield Model
================

This is a final project for [AM 207: Stochastic Optimization, a.k.a. Monte Carlo Methods for Inference and Data Analysis](http://iacs-courses.seas.harvard.edu/courses/am207/) taught by Pavlos Protopapas.

The goal is to build a model that can be used to predict corn yield for a specific field before harvest.
